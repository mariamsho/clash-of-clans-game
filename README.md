Clash of Clans game project

This is a fully functioning Clash of Clans game, Defensive version. 
The game operates with 5 levels, with increasing difficulty, where the player defends his Castle with a mouse controlled cannon. The game includes powerups, health bars, and and kill socre count. 
Each level lasts 5 minutes, a level is won if the Castle survives through the 5 minutes. 
Troops are randomly generated and move in the shortest distance available to the castle using Dijkestra's shortest path algorithm.
